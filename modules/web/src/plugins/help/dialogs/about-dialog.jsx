                    Ballerina Composer provides a flexible and powerful browser-based tool for creating your Ballerina
                    programs. You can build your integrations by creating sequence diagrams, dragging elements from a tool
                    palette onto a canvas. As you build the diagrams, the underlying code is written for you, which you can
                    work with in the Source view. You can also use the Swagger view to define services by writing Swagger
                    definitions. You can switch seamlessly between the Design view, Source view, and Swagger view and create
                    your programs in the way that you like to work.
