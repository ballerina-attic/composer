                    XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup Language) is a fine grained access control language. It is
                    not a simple task to write a policy from sketch without any support. Objective of this project is to
                    develop a tool which compliance with XACML 3.0 specifications and introduce a UI based approach to
                    create XACML policies. The developed application will be easily extensible for future features which
                    will use XACML. And this will include try it capabilities and debugger capabilities for the policies
                    as well.
